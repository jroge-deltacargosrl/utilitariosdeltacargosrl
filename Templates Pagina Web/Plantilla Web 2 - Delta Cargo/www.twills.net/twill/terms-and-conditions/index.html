On giving 14 days’ written notice.</p>
<p>13.2. The Registered User may terminate its agreement to these Platform User Terms, the Platform Services and its use of Twill Platform: 13.2.1. immediately on giving notice if: a) Twill is in material or persistent breach of any provision of the Platform User Terms and, in the case of breaches that may be remedied, fails to remedy that breach within 7 days of request; or 13.2.2. on giving 14 days’ written notice.</p>

Subject to the right to terminate under clauses 13.2and 13.3, the change shall take effect on the date of expiry of the notice. Exceptionally, Twill may give a shorter notice period (other than in the case of any variation to fees, rates or charges) as it deems reasonably necessary for the effective operation of the Twill Platform or Platform Services (in which case the Registered User or Individual User shall be entitled to terminate its use of the Platform Services, the Twill Platform and/or its Login Details with immediate effect by giving written notice at any time during such notice period).</p>
<p>14.4. Twill may give notice in writing to the address (or the email address) specified by the Individual User in the registered user application form (or a subsequent address notified to Twill from time to time) or via the Twill Platform. Service of any notice on the Individual User shall (if applicable) also be deemed to be service on the Registered User. Proof of posting or transmission of any notice shall be deemed to be proof of receipt of the notice at the time when the notice would in the ordinary course be delivered or received. Any notice sent via the Twill Platform shall be deemed to have been received when the notice is first available through the Twill Platform for access by the Individual User.</p>
<p>14.5. Twill and its affiliates, associates and agents will not be liable for any loss (including without limitation loss of profit), damage, delay or failure in performing any of its duties relating to the Platform User Terms caused in whole or in part by the action of any government or governmental agency, natural occurrence, law or regulation (or any change in the interpretation thereof), injunction, currency restriction, sanction, exchange control, industrial action (whether involving its staff or not), war, terrorist action, equipment failure, interruption to power supplies or anything else beyond its reasonable control.</p>
<p>14.6. The Platform User Terms supersedes all previous agreements, communications, representations and discussions between the parties relating to the Twill Platform.

No modification or waiver shall be binding on Twill unless it is in writing and agreed by an authorised representative of Twill.</p>
<p>14.7. References in the Platform User Terms to “in writing” or “written” include communication by email or other electronic form. References in the Platform User Terms to the singular include the plural and vice versa.</p>
<p>14.8. Each of the provisions of the Platform User Terms is severable from the others and if one or more of them becomes void, illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will not be affected in any way.</p>
<p>14.9. The rights of Twill, its affiliates, associates and agents under the Platform User Terms may be exercised as often as necessary and are cumulative and not exclusive of their rights under any applicable law. Any delay in the exercise or nonexercise of any such right is not a waiver of that right.</p>

<p>14.11. Twill may assist or co-operate with authorities in any jurisdiction in relation to any direction or request to disclose personal or other information regarding any Registered User or Individual User or the use of the Twill Platform, Content or Platform Services.</p>

In entering into the Platform User Terms, Twill does so (to the extent of such provisions) not only on its own behalf but also as agent and trustee for such persons.</p>
<p>14.13. To the extent that clause 14.12 is not effective to give such benefit to any Relevant Third Party, it may enforce such provisions in its own name pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

<p>14.14. Twill may process, for the purpose of providing the Twill Platform and Platform Services, any personal information it receives from the Registered User and/or the Individual User in connection with the Platform User Terms. Such processing may take place in countries outside the European Economic Area. The Registered User and the Individual User warrant that processing of such information by Twill in accordance with the Platform User Terms will not put Twill in breach of any applicable law, including without limitation the Data Protection Act 1998, or of the Platform User Terms.</p>
<p>15. Law and Jurisdiction</p>
<p>15.1. The parties agree that the Platform User Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with English law and shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice in London.</p>
